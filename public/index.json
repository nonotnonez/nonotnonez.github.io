Amazone EFS automatically grows and shinks as files are added and removed , so capacity doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to me managed. Servers access shared data in Amazon EFS by using mount targets in each Availability Zone.\nApplications on each server view each mounted file systems as a local path, similar to \u0026ldquo;/mnt/efs\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the following sections, we will:\nLaunch and configure Amazon EFS file system. Mount the file system to an Amazon EC2 instance. Connect a second EC2 instance to the same file system. Share files between the two EC2 instances.

This access can apply to a specific CIDR or to a Security group in the same VPC, or even to a Security group in another VPC connected by peering.\nComponents of Security Group Rule Inbound Rules: These include the source of the traffic and the destination port or port range. The source can be another security group, an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR range, or an IPv4/IPv6 address. "

Changes to the network ACL\u0026rsquo;s rules automatically apply to its associated subnets.\nComponents of a network ACL rule:\nRule Number: Rules are evaluated in sequence order, starting with the lowest number. Once a rule matches traffic, it\u0026rsquo;s immediately applied even if it conflicts with higher-numbered rules. Type: Defines the traffic type (e.g., SSH). Specify traffic types or custom ranges. Protocol: Specify the protocol using standard protocol numbers. Port Range: Define the port or port range for traffic (e.g., HTTP is 80). Source: [Inbound Rule] Defines the traffic origin (CIDR range). Destination: [Outbound Rule] Specifies the traffic destination (CIDR range). Allow/Deny: Choose to Allow or Deny the specified traffic.
