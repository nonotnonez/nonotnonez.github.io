Amazone EFS automatically grows and shinks as files are added and removed , so capacity doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to me managed. Servers access shared data in Amazon EFS by using mount targets in each Availability Zone.\nApplications on each server view each mounted file systems as a local path, similar to \u0026ldquo;/mnt/efs\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the following sections, we will:\nLaunch and configure Amazon EFS file system. Mount the file system to an Amazon EC2 instance. Connect a second EC2 instance to the same file system. Share files between the two EC2 instances. "
